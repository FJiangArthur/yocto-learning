# Lab 03: Custom Meta-Layer
## Creating a Production-Ready Yocto Layer

## Overview

This lab teaches you to create a professional, distributable meta-layer with proper structure, configuration, and documentation. You'll build a complete BSP-style layer that can be shared and maintained independently.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will be able to:
- [ ] Design a well-structured meta-layer architecture
- [ ] Create proper layer configuration (layer.conf)
- [ ] Implement machine and distro configurations
- [ ] Organize recipes into logical categories
- [ ] Write layer documentation and README
- [ ] Version control your layer with Git
- [ ] Test layer compatibility
- [ ] Distribute layers to other developers

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Completed Lab 01 (First Yocto Build)
- [ ] Completed Lab 02 (Custom Recipe)
- [ ] Understanding of layer hierarchy
- [ ] Git knowledge
- [ ] Text editor

## Time Estimate

**Total:** 4-5 hours

- Planning: 30 minutes
- Layer structure: 1 hour
- Configuration: 1.5 hours
- Recipes and organization: 1 hour
- Documentation: 45 minutes
- Testing: 30 minutes

## What You'll Build

1. **meta-lab layer** - Complete custom layer
2. **Layer configuration** - Proper dependencies and priorities
3. **Machine config** - Custom hardware definition
4. **Distro config** - Distribution policies
5. **Recipe collection** - Organized recipe structure
6. **Documentation** - README, LICENSE, and guides
